YSK that calendar invites from Google sent to Apple wil need to be accepted (or rejected) by clickin on "Yes" (or "No") button in the email.
Else the sender will not receice your acceptance (or rejection)

This behaviour is because Apple does not send any automatic calendar related emails to Google.
